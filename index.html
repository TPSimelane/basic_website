            Dubai has the highest population among the cities in the United Arab Emirates. Dubai is also one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates, and its population is majorly made up of expats from other parts of Asia and beyond.

The city attracts millions of tourists every year, mainly due to its attractions such as ultramodern architecture, luxury shopping and unmatched nightlife. Dubai has the worldâ€™s tallest building in the world, it is home to the only 7-star hotel in the world & has ATMs that dispense gold bars.
